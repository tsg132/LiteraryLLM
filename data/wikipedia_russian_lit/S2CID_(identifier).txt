Semantic Scholar is a research tool for scientific literature. It is developed at the Allen Institute for AI and was publicly released in November 2015.[2] Semantic Scholar uses modern techniques in natural language processing to support the research process, for example by providing automatically generated summaries of scholarly papers.[3] The Semantic Scholar team is actively researching the use of artificial intelligence in natural language processing, machine learning, human–computer interaction, and information retrieval.[4]

Semantic Scholar began as a database for the topics of computer science, geoscience, and neuroscience.[5] In 2017, the system began including biomedical literature in its corpus.[5] As of September 2022[update], it includes over 200 million publications from all fields of science.[6]
