Andrei Platonovich Platonov (Russian: Андре́й Плато́нович Плато́нов, IPA: [ɐnˈdrʲej plɐˈtonəvʲɪtɕ plɐˈtonəf]; né Klimentov [Климе́нтов]; 28 August [O.S. 16 August] 1899[1] – 5 January 1951) was a Soviet Russian novelist, short story writer, philosopher, playwright, and poet. Although Platonov regarded himself as a communist, his principal works remained unpublished in his lifetime because of their skeptical attitude toward collectivization of agriculture (1929–1940) and other Stalinist policies, as well as for their experimental, avant-garde form infused with existentialism which was not in line with the dominant socialist realism doctrine. His famous works include the novels Chevengur (1928) and The Foundation Pit  (1930).
