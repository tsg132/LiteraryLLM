Russia has one of the largest video games player bases in the world, with an estimated 65.2 million players nationwide as of 2018.[1] Despite piracy being widespread in the Russian gaming industry,[2]
by 2019, the market more than doubled over the course of five years to the worth of over $2 billion.[3]

In 2001, Russia became the first country in the world to officially recognize competitive video gaming as a sport.[4]
