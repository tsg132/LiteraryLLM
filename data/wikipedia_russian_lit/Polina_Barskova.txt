Polina Barskova (born 1976) is a Russian poet. She was born in Leningrad (today St. Petersburg). Although her biological father was poet Evgeny Rein, she was raised by her adoptive father, scholar Yuri Barskov, and bears his surname.[1] Her first book appeared when she was still a teenager.[citation needed] At the age of 20, she left Russia to pursue a PhD at University of California, Berkeley. She taught Russian literature at Hampshire College, and is now a professor at U.C. Berkeley. [2]

She has published several volumes of poetry, and she was nominated for the Debut Prize and the Andrei Bely Prize in her native Russia. Her selected poems have appeared in English translation under the title The Zoo in Winter. Her work appeared in anthologies such as The Ecco Anthology of International Poetry, co-edited by Ilya Kaminsky, who translated a short volume of her poems This Lamentable City (Tupelo Press, 2010). She has done extensive archival work on the literature of the siege of Leningrad, resulting in the award-winning volume Written in the Dark: Five Poets in the Siege of Leningrad (Ugly Duckling Presse, 2016).[3][4][5]
