Serbian literature (Serbian Cyrillic: Српска књижевност), refers to literature written in Serbian and/or in Serbia and all other lands where Serbs reside.

The history of Serbian literature begins with the independent works from the Nemanjić dynasty era, if not before. With the fall of Serbia and neighboring countries in the 15th century, there is a gap in the literary history in the occupied land. Serbian literature, however, continued uninterrupted in Serbian-inhabited lands under European rule and saw a revival with Baroque works published in the 18th century in what is today Vojvodina. Serbia gained independence following the Serbian Revolution (1804–1815) and Serbian literature has since prospered. Several Serbian writers have achieved international fame.
