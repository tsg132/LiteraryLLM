Regalia of the Russian tsars are the insignia of tsars and emperors of Russia, who ruled from the 13th to the 19th century. Over the centuries, the specific items used by Tsars changed greatly; the largest such shift occurred in the 18th century, when Peter the Great reformed the state to align it more closely with Western European monarchies.[1]

After the Russian Revolution, the Bolsheviks sold the majority of the Romanovs' regalia, but the most important items, including the key coronation regalia, were placed in the Kremlin Armoury. Since 1967, they have been available for public viewing through the Diamond Fund permanent exposition.[2]
