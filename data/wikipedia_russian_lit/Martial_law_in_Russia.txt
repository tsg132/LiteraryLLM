Martial law in Russia (Russian: Военное положение в России) is defined in Russian law as a special legal regime that is introduced in conditions of external aggression or a threat of such. In this way, it differs from the state of emergency, which is introduced in the event of an internal threat such as an attempted coup, unrest or disaster. Martial law should also be distinguished from the State of War- a term that refers to the period between the outbreak of hostilities and their end. The procedure for introducing and abolishing martial law in Russia is defined in the federal constitutional law “On Martial Law” (2002). In modern Russia, martial law was introduced on 19 October 2022 during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine in the annexed regions of Ukraine, which by then were unilaterally declared by the whole state apparatus to be new federal subjects of Russia.[1]
