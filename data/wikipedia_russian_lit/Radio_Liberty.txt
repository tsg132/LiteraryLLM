Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) is an American government-funded media organization broadcasting news and analyses in 27 languages to 23 countries[7] across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Caucasus, and the Middle East. Headquartered in Prague since 1995, RFE/RL operates 21 local bureaus with over 500 core staff, 1,300 freelancers, and 680 employees at its corporate offices in Washington, D.C. Nicola Careem serves as the editor-in-chief.

Founded during the Cold War, RFE began in 1949 targeting Soviet satellite states,[8] while RL, established in 1951, focused on the Soviet Union. Initially funded covertly by the CIA until 1972,[9][10] the two merged in 1976. RFE/RL was headquartered in Munich from 1949 to 1995, with additional broadcasts from Portugal's Gl√≥ria do Ribatejo until 1996. Soviet authorities jammed their signals, and communist regimes often infiltrated their operations.

Today, RFE/RL is a private 501(c)(3) corporation supervised by the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees all government-supported international broadcasting. Since the Revolutions of 1989 and the Soviet Union's dissolution, the organization's European presence has been reduced.
