Chapayev and Pustota (Russian: Чапаев и Пустота), known in the US as Buddha's Little Finger and in the UK as Clay Machine Gun, is a 1996 novel by Victor Pelevin.[1] It follows the dreams of three Moscow mental patients in the early 1990s, with the main protagonist imagining flashbacks to the Russian Civil War, in which he was enlisted by a legendary Bolshevik commander.

Buddha's Little Finger has been compared to the works of Nikolai Gogol and Mikhail Bulgakov; it contains many satirical vignettes, and blurs the line between dream and reality.[2] A film adaption, Buddha's Little Finger by Tony Pemberton, was released in 2015.[3]
