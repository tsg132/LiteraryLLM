This page lists the number of book titles published per country per year from various sources. According to UNESCO, this is an important index of standard of living, education, and of a country's self-awareness.[1] No standardised way to track the number of books published exists which can make it difficult to compare countries or track the industry as a whole.[2] One method is to track how many International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) are registered by each country.[2]
