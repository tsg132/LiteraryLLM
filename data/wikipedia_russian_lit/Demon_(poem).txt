Demon (Russian: Демон) is a poem by Mikhail Lermontov, written in several versions in the years 1829 to 1839. It is considered a masterpiece of European Romantic poetry.

Lermontov began work on the poem when he was about 14 or 15[1][2] but completed it only during his Caucasus exile.[3] Lermontov wrote six major variations of the poem, and the final version was not published until 1842, after his death.
