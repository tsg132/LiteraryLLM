Viktor Borisovich Shklovsky[1] (Russian: Ви́ктор Бори́сович Шкло́вский, IPA: [ˈʂklofskʲɪj]; 24 January [O.S. 12 January] 1893 – 6 December 1984) was a Russian and Soviet literary theorist, critic, writer, and pamphleteer.[2] He is one of the major figures associated with Russian formalism.

Viktor Shklovsky's Theory of Prose was published in 1925.[3] Shklovsky himself is still praised as "one of the most important literary and cultural theorists of the twentieth century"[4] (Modern Language Association Prize Committee); "one of the most lively and irreverent minds of the last century"[5] (David Bellos); "one of the most fascinating figures of Russian cultural life in the twentieth century"[6] (Tzvetan Todorov)
