Russian culture (Russian: Культура России, romanized: Kul'tura Rossii, IPA: [kʊlʲˈturə rɐˈsʲiɪ]) has been formed by the nation's history, its geographical location and its vast expanse, religious and social traditions, and both Eastern[1] and Western influence.[2] Cultural scientists believe that the influence of the East was completely insignificant, since the Mongols did not coexist with the Russians during conquest, and the indigenous peoples were rather subjected to reverse cultural assimilation. Unlike the Scandinavian and more western neighbors, which have become the main reason for the formation of modern culture among Russians.[3] Russian writers and philosophers have played an important role in the development of European thought.[4][5] The Russians have also greatly influenced classical music,[6] ballet,[7] sport,[8] painting,[9] and cinema.[10] The nation has also made pioneering contributions to science and technology and space exploration.[11][12]
