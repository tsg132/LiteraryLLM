Mikhail Afanasyevich Bulgakov (/bʊlˈɡɑːkɒf/ buul-GAH-kof; Russian: Михаил Афанасьевич Булгаков, IPA: [mʲɪxɐˈil ɐfɐˈnasʲjɪvʲɪdʑ bʊlˈɡakəf];[1] 15 May [O.S. 3 May] 1891 – 10 March 1940) was a Russian writer, medical doctor, and playwright. His novel The Master and Margarita,[2] published posthumously, has been called one of the masterpieces of the 20th century.[3]

He also wrote the novel The White Guard and the plays Ivan Vasilievich, Flight (also called The Run), and The Days of the Turbins. He wrote mostly about the horrors of the Russian Civil War and about the fate of Russian intellectuals and officers of the Tsarist Army caught up in revolution and Civil War.[4]

Some of his works (Flight, all his works between the years 1922 and 1926, and others) were banned by the Soviet government, and personally by Joseph Stalin, after it was decided by them that they "glorified emigration and White generals".[5] On the other hand, Stalin loved The Days of the Turbins (also called  The Turbin Brothers) very much and reportedly saw it at least 15 times.[6][7]
