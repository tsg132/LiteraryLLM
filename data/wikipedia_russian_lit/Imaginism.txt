Imaginism was a literary association of Russian poets of the Silver Age, which existed in 1918-1925. Representatives of imaginism stated that the purpose of creativity is to create an image. The main expressive means of imaginists is metaphor, often metaphorical chains that juxtapose various elements of two images: direct and figurative. The creative practice of the imaginists was characterized by outrageous, anarchic motives.
