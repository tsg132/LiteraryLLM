The Russian Criminal Code (Russian: Уголовный кодекс Российской Федерации, frequently abbreviated УК РФ) is the prime source of the Law of the Russian Federation concerning criminal offences. The 1996 Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (UGKRF) came into force on 1 January 1997.[1] The new Criminal Code replaced the Soviet analogue of 1960.[1] The main changes deal with economic crimes and property crimes. Most of the other chapters were already amended to correspond to new Russian realities.[citation needed]

On 8 January 1997, President Yeltsin signed the Criminal Correctional Code to regulate the conditions of the sentences. The first Criminal Procedural Code was enacted on 18 December 2001; it has subsequently been amended.[2]
