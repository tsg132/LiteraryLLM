Scottish Gaelic literature refers to literary works composed in the Scottish Gaelic language, which is, like Irish and Manx, a member of the Goidelic branch of Celtic languages. Gaelic literature was also composed in GÃ idhealtachd communities throughout the global Scottish diaspora where the language has been and is still spoken.
