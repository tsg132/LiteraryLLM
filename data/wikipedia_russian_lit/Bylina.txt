A bylina (Russian: былина, IPA: [bɨˈlʲinə]; pl. былины, byliny) is a type of Russian oral epic poem.[1][2]

The oldest byliny are set in the 10th to 12th centuries in Kievan Rus', while others deal with all periods of Russian and Ukrainian history.[1] Byliny narratives are loosely based on historical fact, but greatly embellished with fantasy or hyperbole.[3]
