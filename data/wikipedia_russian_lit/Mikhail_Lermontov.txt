Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov (/ˈlɛərməntɒf/ LAIR-mən-tof, US also /-tɔːf/ -⁠tawf;[1] Russian: Михаи́л Ю́рьевич Ле́рмонтов, IPA: [mʲɪxɐˈil ˈjʉrʲjɪvʲɪtɕ ˈlʲerməntəf]; 15 October [O.S. 3 October] 1814 – 27 July [O.S. 15 July] 1841) was a Russian Romantic writer, poet and painter, sometimes called "the poet of the Caucasus", the most important Russian poet after Alexander Pushkin's death in 1837 and the greatest figure in Russian Romanticism. His influence on Russian literature is felt in modern times, through his poetry, but also his prose, which founded the tradition of the Russian psychological novel.

Lermontov was born on October 15, 1814 in Moscow into the Lermontov family and grew up in Tarkhany. Lermontov's father, Yuri Petrovich, was a military officer who married Maria Mikhaylovna Arsenyeva, a young heiress from an aristocratic family. Their marriage was unhappy, Maria's health deteriorated, and she died of tuberculosis in 1817. A family dispute ensued over Lermontov's custody, resulting in his grandmother, Elizaveta Arsenyeva, raising him. She provided excellent home education, nurturing his talents in languages, music, and painting. However, his health was fragile, and he suffered from scrofula and rickets. His grandmother's strict control caused him emotional turmoil, leading to his development as a lonely and introspective individual. Lermontov's early life experiences and education laid the foundation for his literary achievements.

In 1827, Lermontov moved to Moscow with his grandmother and joined the Moscow University's boarding school. He excelled academically, influenced by his tutors Alexey Merzlyakov and Semyon Rayich, and started to write poetry. By 1829, Lermontov had written notable poems. His literary career began to take shape, with his early works reflecting the influences of Alexander Pushkin and Lord Byron. Lermontov's early education included extensive travel to the Caucasus for his health, which greatly impressed him and influenced his work.

In 1832, Lermontov moved to Saint Petersburg and enrolled in the School of Cavalry Junkers and Ensign of the Guard, eventually joining the Life-Guard Hussar regiment. His literary career flourished, but his sharp wit and satirical works earned him many enemies. The poem "Death of the Poet," written after the death of Alexander Pushkin, gained Lermontov significant fame, but led to his first exile to the Caucasus due to its controversial content. During his exile, Lermontov continued to write, producing some of his most famous works, including A Hero of Our Time. His experiences in the Caucasus provided rich material for his poetry and prose. Despite returning to St. Petersburg briefly, his rebellious nature and another duel led to his second exile. In 1841, Lermontov was killed in a duel with fellow officer Nikolai Martynov. His death marked the loss of one of Russia's most promising literary talents.
