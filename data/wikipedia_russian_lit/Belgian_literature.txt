Because modern Belgium is a multilingual country,[note 1] Belgian literature is often treated as a branch of French literature or Dutch literature. 
Some writing also exists in the regional languages of Belgium, with published works in both the Walloon language, closely related to French, and also in various regional Flemish or Dutch-related dialects.

German is the third official language in Belgium and is spoken by a small community of about 70,000 German-speakers of the German-speaking Community of Belgium in the border region Eupen-Malmedy. See de:Belgische_Literatur#Die_deutsche_Literatur_in_Belgien.
