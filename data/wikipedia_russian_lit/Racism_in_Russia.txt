Racism in Russia mainly appears in the form of negative attitudes towards non-ethnic Russian citizens, immigrants or tourists and negative actions against them by some Russians. Traditionally, Russian racism includes antisemitism and Tatarophobia, as well as hostility towards the various peoples of the Caucasus, Central Asia, East Asia, South Asia and Africa.[1]

According to the United Nations, Russia's immigrant population is the world's third-largest, numbering over 11.6 million.[2] Due to the country's declining population, and the low birth rates and high death rates of ethnic Russians, the Russian government has tried to increase immigration to the country in the last decade;[3] which has led to millions of migrants flow into Russia from mainly post-Soviet states, many of whom are illegal and remain undocumented.[4][5][6]

Under serious police pressure, the number of racist acts started to decline in Russia from 2009.[7] In 2016, it was reported that Russia had seen an â€œimpressive" decrease in hate crimes.[8]
