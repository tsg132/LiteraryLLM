Poetics is the study or theory of poetry, specifically the study or theory of device, structure, form, type, and effect with regards to poetry,[1] though usage of the term can also refer to literature broadly.[2][3] Poetics is distinguished from hermeneutics by its focus on the synthesis of non-semantic elements in a text rather than its semantic interpretation.[4] Most literary criticism combines poetics and hermeneutics in a single analysis; however, one or the other may predominate given the text and the aims of the one doing the reading.
