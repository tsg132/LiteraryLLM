Maxim Albertovich Amelin (Russian: Максим Альбертович Амелин; born 7 January 1970) is a Russian poet, critic, essayist, editor, and translator. He was born in Kursk, Russia, where he graduated from the Kursk Commercial College (Курский торговый техникум) and did his military service in the Soviet Army. He studied in the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow from 1991 to 1994, where he worked with Olesya Nikolayeva [ru]. He was commercial director and director of the St. Petersburg publishing house Symposium [ru] from 1995 to 2007 and has been the Editor-in-Chief of the Moscow publishing house OGI since 2008.[1] He is married to the poet Anna Zolotaryova [ru][2] and lives in Moscow.

Tatyana Bek was the first to define his style, calling him an "archaist-innovator."[3] His poetry is influenced by classical Greek and Roman poetry and by Russian poetry of the 18th century.[4][5] He has translated the works of Catullus, Pindar, and Homer, as well as poetry from Georgian, Italian, Ukrainian, and other languages.  

Amelin has edited and published the works of several lesser-known Russian writers, including Dmitry Ivanovich, Count Khvostov (1757-1835), Aleksandr Yefimovich Izmaylov (1779-1831), Sergey Yevgenyevich Neldikhen [ru] (1891-1942), Anna Petrovna Bunina (1774-1829), and Vasily Petrovich Petrov [ru] (1736-1799).  

In 2017, Amelin was awarded the Poet Prize [ru], a national Russian prize that has been awarded since 2005.[citation needed]
