Macedonian literature (Macedonian: македонска книжевност) begins with the Ohrid Literary School in the First Bulgarian Empire (nowadays North Macedonia)[citation needed] in 886. These first written works in the dialects of the Old Church Slavonic were religious.[1] The school was established by St. Clement of Ohrid.[2][3]  The Macedonian recension[clarification needed] at that time was part of the Old Church Slavonic and it did not represent one regional dialect but a generalized form of early Eastern South Slavic.[4] The standardization of Macedonian in the 20th century provided good ground for further development of the modern Macedonian literature and this period is the richest one in the history of the literature itself.
