Hong Kong literature is 20th-century and subsequent writings from or about Hong Kong or by writers from Hong Kong, primarily in the poetry, performance, and fiction media. Hong Kong literature reflects the area's unique history during the 20th century as a fusion of British colonial, Cantonese, and sea-trading culture. It has mainly been written in Vernacular Chinese and, to a lesser extent, English.
