Georgian literature (Georgian: ქართული ლიტერატურა) refers to a long literary heritage, with some of the oldest surviving texts in Georgian language dating back to the 5th century. A golden age of Georgian literature flourished under the unified kingdom of David IV in the 11th century. However, political fragmentation and foreign invasions following a peak in literary tradition during the reign of Queen Tamar (1184-1213 CE) led to a cultural decline.
