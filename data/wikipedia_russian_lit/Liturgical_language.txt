A sacred language, liturgical language or holy language is a language that is cultivated and used primarily for religious reasons (like church service) by people who speak another, primary language in their daily lives.

Some religions, or parts of them, regard the language of their sacred texts as in itself sacred. These include Latin in Roman Catholicism, Hebrew in Judaism, Arabic in Islam and Sanskrit in Hinduism, and Punjabi in Sikhism. By contrast Christian denominations outside of Catholicism and Buddhism do not generally regard their sacred languages as sacred in themselves. Akkadian was a long used liturgical language.
