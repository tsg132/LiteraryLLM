Civil defense in Russia is the system of measures to protect people and material assets in the Russian Federation in the event of hostilities, natural disasters or technological disasters, as well as the preparation of such measures. These measures include sheltering, evacuation, disguising facilities, first aid and basic residents.

The procedure for organizing civil defense is enshrined in the federal laws On Civil Defense (1998), On Protection against Emergencies of Natural and Technogenic Character (1994) and On Emergency and Rescue Services (1995).
