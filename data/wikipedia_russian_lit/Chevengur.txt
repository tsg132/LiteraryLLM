Chevengur (Russian: Чевенгур) is a socio-philosophical novel by Andrei Platonov, written in 1928. It is his longest work and often regarded by scholars as the most significant of his works.[1] Although its fragments were published in the Soviet magazine Krasnaya Nov, the novel was banned in the Soviet Union until 1988. Full text of the novel was published by Ardis in 1972. 

The novel was first translated into English in 1978 by Anthony Olcott.

According to N. Poltavtseva, there is reason to speak of a "philosophical trilogy", which includes the novels Chevengur, The Foundation Pit and Soul.[2]
