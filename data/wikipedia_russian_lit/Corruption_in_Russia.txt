Corruption is considered a very serious problem in Russia,[1] impacting various aspects of life, including the economy,[2] business,[3] politics[citation needed], public administration,[4] law enforcement,[5][6] healthcare,[7][8] and education.[9] It hinders economic development, contributes to inequality, and undermines democracy and human rights[citation needed]. The phenomenon of corruption is strongly established in the historical model of public governance, and attributed to general weakness of rule of law in the country.[1] Transparency International stated in 2022, "Corruption is endemic in Russia" and assigned it the lowest score of any European country in their Corruption Perceptions Index for 2024.[10] It has, under the regime of Vladimir Putin, been variously characterized as a kleptocracy,[11] an oligarchy,[12] and a plutocracy; owing to its crony capitalism economic system.[13][14]
