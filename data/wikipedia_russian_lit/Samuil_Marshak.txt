Samuil Yakovlevich Marshak (alternative spelling: Marchak) (Russian: Самуил Яковлевич Маршак; 3 November [O.S. 22 October] 1887 – 4 July 1964) was a Soviet writer of Belarusian Jewish origin, translator and poet who wrote for both children and adults. He translated the sonnets and some other of the works of William Shakespeare, English poetry (including poems for children), and poetry from other languages. Maxim Gorky proclaimed Marshak to be "the founder of Russia's (Soviet) children's literature".[1]
