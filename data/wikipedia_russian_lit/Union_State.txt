The Union State[b] is a supranational union consisting of Belarus and Russia, with the stated aim of deepening the relationship between the two states through integration in economic and defence policy.[6][7] Originally, the Union State aimed to create a confederation; however, both countries currently retain their independence.[8]

The Union State is based on a previous international treaty between Russia and Belarus[9] made on 2 April 1997.[10] Although it consists of only Russia and Belarus, other countries are allowed to join.[7] The supranational union is ruled through the Supreme State Council[11] and other governing bodies.[12] As of 2025, the current president of the Supreme State Council of the Union is Alexander Lukashenko, who has held the position since 2000.[13] The present goal of the Union State mainly focuses on economic integration,[14] taxation,[15] and integration of defence and intelligence apparatus.[16]
