Bulgarian literature is literature written by Bulgarians or residents of Bulgaria, or written in the Bulgarian language; usually the latter is the defining feature. Bulgarian literature can be said to be one of the oldest among the Slavic peoples, having its roots during the late 9th century and the times of Simeon I of the First Bulgarian Empire.[1]

Notable modern Bulgarian works of literature are The Peach Thief by Emiliyan Stanev, September by Geo Milev, Under The Yoke by Ivan Vazov, The Windmill by Elin Pelin, and Depths by Dora Gabe. The book Wild Stories (Диви разкази, Divi Razkazi) by Nikolay Haytov is included in the UNESCO Historical Collection.[2]
