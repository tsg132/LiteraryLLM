The Washington Post, locally known as The Post and, informally, WaPo or WP, is an American daily newspaper published in Washington, D.C., the national capital. It is the most widely circulated newspaper in the Washington metropolitan area[5][6] and has a national audience. As of 2023, the PostÂ has 135,980 print subscribers and 2.5 million digital subscribers, both of which are the third-largest among U.S. newspapers after The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.

The Post was founded in 1877. In its early years, it went through several owners and struggled both financially and editorially. In 1933, financier Eugene Meyer purchased it out of bankruptcy and revived its health and reputation; this work was continued by his successors Katharine and Phil Graham, Meyer's daughter and son-in-law, respectively, who bought out several rival publications. The Post's 1971 printing of the Pentagon Papers helped spur opposition to the Vietnam War. Reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein led the investigation into the break-in at the Democratic National Committee, which developed into the Watergate scandal and the 1974 resignation of President Richard Nixon. In October 2013, the Graham family sold the newspaper to Nash Holdings, a holding company owned by Jeff Bezos, for $250 million.[7]

As of 2024, the newspaper had won the Pulitzer Prize 76 times for its work,[8] the second-most of any publication after The New York Times.[9][10] It is considered a newspaper of record in the U.S.[11][12][13] Post journalists have received 18 Nieman Fellowships and 368 White House News Photographers Association awards.[14][15] The paper is well known for its political reporting and is one of the few remaining American newspapers to operate foreign bureaus,[16] with international breaking news hubs in London and Seoul.[17]
