Domostroy[a] (Russian: Домостро́й, IPA: [dəmɐˈstroj], lit. 'Domestic Order') is a 16th-century Russian set of household rules, instructions and advice pertaining to various religious, social, domestic, and family matters of Russian society. Core Domostroy values tended to reinforce obedience and submission to God, the tsar, and the church. Key obligations were fasting, prayer, icon veneration and the giving of alms.
