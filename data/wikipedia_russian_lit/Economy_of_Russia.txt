The economy of Russia  is an emerging and developing,[2] high-income,[27] industrialized,[28] mixed market-oriented economy.[29] It has the eleventh-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP and the fourth-largest economy by GDP (PPP).[5] Due to a volatile currency exchange rate, its GDP measured in nominal terms fluctuates sharply.[30] Russia was the last major economy to join the World Trade Organization (WTO), becoming a member in 2012.[31]

Russia has large amounts of energy resources throughout its vast landmass, particularly natural gas and petroleum, which play a crucial role in its energy self-sufficiency and exports.[32] The country has been widely described as an energy superpower;[33] with it having the largest natural gas reserves in the world,[34] the second-largest coal reserves,[35] the eighth-largest oil reserves,[36] and the largest oil shale reserves in Europe.[37] Russia is the world's leading natural gas exporter,[38] the second-largest natural gas producer,[39] the second-largest oil exporter[40] and producer,[41] and the third-largest coal exporter.[42] Its foreign exchange reserves are the fourth-largest in the world.[43] Russia has a labour force of about 72 million people, which is the eighth-largest in the world.[11] It is the third-largest exporter of arms in the world.[44] The oil and gas sector accounted up to roughly 40% of Russia's federal budget revenues, and up to 60% of its exports in 2019.[45]

Russia's human development is ranked as "very high" in the annual Human Development Index.[46] Roughly 70% of Russia's total GDP is driven by domestic consumption,[47] and the country has the world's twelfth-largest consumer market.[48] Its social security system comprised roughly 16% of the total GDP in 2015.[49] Russia has the fifth-highest number of billionaires in the world.[50] However, its income inequality remains comparatively high,[51] caused by the variance of natural resources among its federal subjects, leading to regional economic disparities.[52][53] High levels of corruption,[54] a shrinking labor force,[55] and an aging and declining population also remain major barriers to future economic growth.[56][57]

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the country has faced extensive sanctions and other negative financial actions from the Western world and its allies which have the aim of isolating the Russian economy from the Western financial system.[58] However, Russia's economy has shown resilience to such measures broadly, and has maintained economic stability and growthâ€”driven primarily by high military expenditure,[59] rising household consumption and wages,[60] low unemployment,[13] and increased government spending.[61] Yet, experts predict the sanctions will have a long-term negative effect on the Russian economy.[62]
