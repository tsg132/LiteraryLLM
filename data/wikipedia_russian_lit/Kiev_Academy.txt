National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy (abbr. NaUKMA) (Ukrainian: Національний університет «Києво-Могилянська академія» (НаУКМА)), colloquially known as Mohylianka (Ukrainian: Могилянка), is a highly ranked national research university located in a historic section of Kyiv, Ukraine.[5] The university is bilingual in Ukrainian and English[6] and is one of Ukraine's few universities with internationally recognized diplomas.[7] NaUKMA takes part in numerous international university collaborations, such as the European University Association.[8][9][10] With around 4000 students, NaUKMA is one of the smallest universities in Ukraine. 

The university takes its name from the institution cited as its main predecessor, the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy established in 1615 and operating until 1819. The NaUKMA is located on that Academy's grounds in the ancient Podil neighborhood. In 1991, the modern university was organized, and teaching began the following year. Alumni of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy played a formative role in the intellectual and church life of Ukraine and Russia in 17th and 18th centuries.[11][12] Among the most notable alumni were hetman Ivan Mazepa and philosopher Hryhorii Skovoroda. As well, Theophan Prokopovich as a rector of the Kyiv-Mogila Academy elaborated upon and implemented Peter the Great's reform of the Russian Orthodox Church. The university is known as pro-Western and served as headquarters for Orange Revolution activists.[7]
