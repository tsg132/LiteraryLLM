The Christianization of Kievan Rus' was a long and complicated process that took place in several stages.[1] In 867, Patriarch Photius of Constantinople told other Christian patriarchs that the Rus' people were converting enthusiastically, but his efforts seem to have entailed no lasting consequences, since the Russian Primary Chronicle[2][3] and other Slavonic sources describe the tenth-century Rus' as still firmly entrenched in Slavic paganism. The traditional view, as recorded in the Russian Primary Chronicle,[4][5] is that the definitive Christianization of Kievan Rus' dates happened c. 988[6][7] (the year is disputed[8]), when Vladimir the Great was baptized in Chersonesus (Korsun) and proceeded to baptize his family and people in Kiev. The latter events are traditionally referred to as baptism of Rus'  (Russian: Крещение Руси; Ukrainian: Хрещення Русі; Belarusian: Вадохрышча Русі) in Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian literature.[9]
