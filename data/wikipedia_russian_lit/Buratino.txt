Buratino (Russian: Буратино) is the main character of Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy's 1936 fairy tale The Golden Key, or the Adventures of Buratino, which is based on the 1883 Italian novel The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi.[1][2] Buratino originated as a character in the commedia dell'arte. The name Buratino derives from the Italian burattino, which means "wooden puppet" or "doll".[3] The book was published in 1936; the figure of Buratino quickly became hugely popular among children in the Soviet Union and remains so in Russia to this day (Buratino is one of the most popular characters of Russian children's literature). The story has been made into several films, including the animated 1959 film and the live-action 1975 film.
