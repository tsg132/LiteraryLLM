The ruble or rouble[c] (Russian: рубль, romanized: rublʹ; symbol: ₽; ISO code: RUB) is the currency of the Russian Federation. Banknotes and coins are issued by the Central Bank of Russia, which is Russia's monetary authority independent of all other government bodies.[14]

As of April 2019,[update] the ruble was the 17th-most traded currency in the world,[15] however, following the 2022 sanctions, as of April 2022, the ruble dropped to being the 34th most traded currency in the world.[16] The ruble is subdivided into 100 kopecks which have fallen out of use due to inflation.

The ruble was the currency of the Russian Empire, which was replaced by the Soviet ruble during the Soviet Union era. Following the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, by 1992, the Soviet ruble (code: SUR) was replaced in the Russian Federation by the Russian ruble (code: RUR) at par. The Russian ruble then further continued to be used in eleven post-Soviet states, forming a "ruble zone" until 1993.[11][12][13] The ruble was further redenominated with the new code "RUB" just preceding the 1998 Russian financial crisis, and was exchanged at the rate of 1,000 RUR = 1 RUB.[17]
