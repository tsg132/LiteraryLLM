Chuvash (UK: /ˈtʃuːvɑːʃ/ CHOO-vahsh,[3] US: /tʃʊˈvɑːʃ/ chuu-VAHSH;[4] Чӑвашла, translit. Çăvaşla, IPA: [tɕəʋaʃˈla])[a] is a Turkic language spoken in European Russia, primarily in the Chuvash Republic and adjacent areas. It is the only surviving member of the Oghur branch of Turkic languages, one of the two principal branches of the Turkic family.[5]

The writing system for the Chuvash language is based on the Cyrillic script, employing all of the letters used in the Russian alphabet and adding four letters of its own: Ӑ, Ӗ, Ҫ and Ӳ.
