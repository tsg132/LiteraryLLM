In contemporary Russia, the far-right scene spans a wide spectrum of political groups, authors, activists, political movements and intellectual circles.[1][2] The mainstream radical right that is allowed or supported by the government to participate in official mass media and public life includes parties such as the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) and Rodina as well as far-right political thinkers such as Aleksandr Dugin and Lev Gumilev.[1] Other movements of Russia's far right include actors like the Movement Against Illegal Immigration and contemporary successors of the Pamyat organization.[1]

Some of the main radical right-wing groups and figures in contemporary Russia had become active in politics before the dissolution of the Soviet Union.[3] Alexander Dugin and Vladimir Zhirinovsky started their political career in the 1980s.[3] Zhirinovsky's LDPR and Dugin's Eurasia Movement and Eurasian Youth Union and affiliated organizations remain fixtures in Russia's far-right scene and, since 1991, were joined by many other parties and networks.[3]

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, radical right-wing ideas have shaped Russia's political system, public discourse, domestic and foreign policies, and intellectual life.[3][4]
