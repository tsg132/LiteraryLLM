A restoration of the Russian monarchy is a hypothetical event in which the Russian monarchy, which has been non-existent since the abdication of Nicholas II on 15 March 1917 and the execution of him and the rest of his closest family in 1918, is reinstated in today's Russian Federation. The only political party which today advocates such a restoration is the Monarchist Party.

Most proposals for the restoration of the monarchy envision the return to be to a constitutional role.
