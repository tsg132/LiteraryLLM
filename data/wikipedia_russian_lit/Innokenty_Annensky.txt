Innokenty Fyodorovich Annensky (Russian: Инноке́нтий Фёдорович А́нненский, IPA: [ɪnɐˈkʲenʲtʲɪj ˈfʲɵdərəvʲɪtɕ ˈanʲɪnskʲɪj] ⓘ; (1 September [O.S. 20 August] 1855, Omsk – 13 December [O.S. 30 November] 1909, Saint Petersburg) was a poet, critic, scholar, and translator, representative of the first wave of Russian Symbolism, although he was not well known for his poetry until after his death.[1] In fact, Annensky never wrote professionally; he made little to no income from writing. Instead, he spent his career in academia as a full-time professor and administrator, translator of classic Greek works, and writer of essays and reviews.[2]  Despite this, Annensky is considered to be one of the most significant Russian poets from the early 20th century.[3] Critics have cited Annensky's connection to French Symbolism and to the French poet Stéphane Mallarmé for their shared use of "associative symbolism."[4] Annensky was considered to be an under-recognized or neglected poet, but he later gained recognition, particularly in the West, because a number of later Russian poets, such as Mandelstam, Akhmatova, Pasternak, and Mayakovsky, were inspired and influenced by his work.[5]
