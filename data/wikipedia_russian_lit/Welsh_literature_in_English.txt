Welsh writing in English (Welsh: Llenyddiaeth Gymreig yn Saesneg), (previously Anglo-Welsh literature) is a term used to describe works written in the English language by Welsh writers.

The term 'Anglo-Welsh' replaced an earlier attempt to define this category of writing as 'Anglo-Cymric'.[1] The form 'Anglo-Welsh' was used by Idris Bell in 1922[2] and revived by Raymond Garlick and Roland Mathias when they renamed their literary periodical Dock Leaves as The Anglo-Welsh Review[3] and later further defined the term in their anthology Anglo-Welsh Poetry 1480-1980 as denoting a literature in which "the first element of the compound being understood to specify the language and the second the provenance of the writing".[4]
Although recognised as a distinctive entity only since the 20th century, Garlick and Mathias sought to identify a tradition of writing in English in Wales going back much further.[5] The need for a separate identity for this kind of writing arose because the term 'Welsh Literature' describes Welsh-language literature which has its own continuous tradition going back to the sixth century poem known as Y Gododdin.
