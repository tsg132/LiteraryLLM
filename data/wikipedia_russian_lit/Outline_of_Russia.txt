With 143 million people, Russia is the ninth most populated country. Russia has the world's largest mineral and energy resources, has the world's largest forest reserves, and its lakes contain approximately one-quarter of the Earth's fresh liquid water.

Geography of Russia

Mercator projection distorts Russia's appearance from crescent-like shape (as seen on a globe) into a fish-like or bear-like outline; also making the uninhabited area of Russia (e.g. food-less cold tundra and taiga) look 3-4 times bigger than it already is.
