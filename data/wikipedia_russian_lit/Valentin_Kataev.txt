Valentin Petrovich Kataev (Russian: Валенти́н Петро́вич Ката́ев; also spelled Katayev or Kataiev; 28 January [O.S. 16 January] 1897 – 12 April 1986) was a Soviet writer and editor who managed to create penetrating works discussing post-revolutionary social conditions without running afoul of the demands of official Soviet style. Kataev is credited with suggesting the idea for The Twelve Chairs to his brother Yevgeny Petrov and Ilya Ilf. In return, Kataev insisted that the novel be dedicated to him, in all editions and translations.[1] Kataev's relentless imagination, sensitivity, and originality made him one of the most distinguished Soviet writers.
