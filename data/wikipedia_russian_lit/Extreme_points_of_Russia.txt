This is a list of the extreme points and extreme elevations in Russia.

The northernmost and easternmost points of Russia coincide with those of Eurasia (both for the mainland and including the islands).

The extreme points of the Soviet Union were identical, except that the southernmost point of the Soviet Union was Kushka in Turkmenistan, and the extreme elevation was the Communism Peak in Tajikistan, at 7,495 metres (24,590Â ft). The other extreme points of Russia are the same as those of the Soviet Union.

From 1799 until 1867 the easternmost point of the Russian Empire was located in North America, on the border between Russian Alaska and British North America, which superimposed on the then International Date Line. The westernmost point of the Empire was located at Ruda Komorska in Congress Poland from 1815 until its occupation by German and Austro-Hungarian troops in 1915. Kushka in present-day Turkmenistan had been the southernmost point of the Empire since 1885. Again, until the Alaska Purchase, the peak of Bolshaya was the extreme point of elevation in the Empire, at 6,194 m above sea level.
