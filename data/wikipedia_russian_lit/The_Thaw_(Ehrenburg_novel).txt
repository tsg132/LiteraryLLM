The Thaw (Russian: Оттепель, Ottepel) is a short novel by Ilya Ehrenburg first published in the spring 1954 issue of Novy Mir.[1] It coined the name for the  Khrushchev Thaw, the period of liberalization following the 1953 death of Stalin. The novel marked a break both from Ehrenburg's earlier purely pro-Soviet work, and from previous ideas about socialist realism.[1][2]
