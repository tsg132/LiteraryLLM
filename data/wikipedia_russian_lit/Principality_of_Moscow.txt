The Principality of Moscow[b] or Muscovy[c] (1263–1389), later the Grand Principality of Moscow[d] (1389–1547),[e] was a medieval Russian principality.[9] Its capital was the city of Moscow.[10]

Moscow became a separate principality when Daniel (r. 1263–1303), the youngest son of Alexander Nevsky, received the city and surrounding area as an appanage.[11] By the end of the 13th century, Moscow had become one of the leading principalities within the grand principality of Vladimir, alongside Tver.[12] A struggle between the princes of Moscow and Tver began after Mikhail of Tver became grand prince in 1304.[13] Yury (r. 1303–1325) contested the title and was later made grand prince in 1318 by the khan of the Golden Horde, who held suzerainty over the princes. However, Yury lost the title four years later.[14]

Ivan I (r. 1325–1340) regained the title of grand prince and was able to collect tribute for the khan from other Russian princes, which increased Moscow's wealth.[15] The seat of the Russian Orthodox Church was also moved from Vladimir to Moscow, establishing it as the spiritual center of Russian Orthodoxy.[16] Ivan I defeated Tver and secured the grand princely title for his sons, Simeon (r. 1340–1353) and Ivan II (r. 1353–1359). After Ivan II's death, the title was temporarily lost until Dmitry (r. 1359–1389) regained it and elevated Moscow to a grand principality.[17] He also inflicted a milestone defeat on the Tatars in 1380, which greatly increased Moscow's prestige.[18]

As the Golden Horde declined, its hegemony was increasingly challenged.[19] Vasily I (r. 1389–1425) expanded his principality, but was ultimately forced to resume paying tribute due to Tatar raids.[20] Vasily II (r. 1425–1462) consolidated his control of Moscow after a period of internal struggle and his reign saw the Russian Church declare autocephaly.[21] Ivan III (r. 1462–1505) absorbed nearly all of the Russian states and laid the foundations for a centralized state.[22] His reign marks the end of the appanage period and the beginning of a new period in Russian history known as Muscovite Russia.[23] His defeat of the Tatars in 1480 also traditionally marks the end of Tatar suzerainty.[24] Vasily III (r. 1505–1533) completed the annexation of the remaining appanages,[25] and his son Ivan IV (r. 1533–1584) was crowned as the first Russian tsar in 1547, thereby formally establishing the Tsardom of Russia.[26]
