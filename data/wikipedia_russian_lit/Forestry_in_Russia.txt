Forestry in Russia is a set of industries related to wood harvesting and processing. It is one of the oldest sectors in the country's economy, Russia's timber industry is valued at $20 billion per year, and as at 2022, is the second largest producer of industrial roundwood.[1] Russia has more than a fifth of the world's forests, making it the largest forest country in the world. According to data for 2015, the total forest area has exceeded 885 million hectares (2,190×10^6 acres), representing 45% of the total area of the country. The stock of wood in the area was 82 billion cubic meters. However in 2023 academics complained that not enough information had been published.[2]

A significant proportion of revenue from the industry is generated by the export of raw materials from sawing logs. For a long time Russia was the main supplier of raw wood material in Europe. However, according to a 2012 study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Government of the Russian Federation,[3][4] the potential of Russian forests is underutilized and Russia's share of the global trade in forest products is less than 4%.[5][6][7][8]

Russia's timber industry sectors, as part of the Russia's total industrial production, are seventh place in terms of production and fifth place in terms of national exports.[4] The main product of the Russia's forest industry is timber, whose share among the total volume of exported timber is approximately 75 - 80%. The logging industry is considered to be the basic direction of the whole forest complex. By the end of the 1980s, the USSR ranked second in the world in the export of wood, second only to the United States. As a result of numerous economic changes throughout the past decade, Russia has moved between 6th and 7th place worldwide in this index.

All data is due to be recorded in the national forest inventory accounting system by 2025.[9]
