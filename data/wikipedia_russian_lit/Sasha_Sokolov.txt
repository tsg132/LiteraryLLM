Sasha Sokolov (Russian: Александр Всеволодович Соколов, romanized: Alexander Vsevolodovitch Sokolov; born November 6, 1943, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) is a writer of Russian literature.

He became known worldwide in the 1970s after his first novel, A School for Fools, was published in translation by Ardis Publishers (Ann Arbor, Michigan) in the US, and was later reissued by Four Walls Eight Windows. Sokolov is one of the most important authors of 20th-century Russian literature. He is acclaimed for his unorthodox use of language, and for his play with rhythms, sounds and word-associations. The author himself coined the term "proeziia" for his work—in between prose and poetry (an English analog for the term could be "proetry").
