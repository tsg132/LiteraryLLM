Kuwait has produced several prominent contemporary writers. There is also evidence that Kuwaiti culture has long been interactive with English and French literature.[1] Some of the translators include Yaqoub Al-Hamad, Fathil Khalaf, poet Suleiman Al-Khulaifi, and Mahmoud Tawfeeq Ahmad who translated a number of short French plays by Moli√®re.[2]
