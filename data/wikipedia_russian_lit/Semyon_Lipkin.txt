Semyon Izrailevich Lipkin (Russian: Семён Израилевич Липкин) (6 September 1911 – 31 March 2003) was a Russian writer, poet, and literary translator.[1]

Lipkin's work gained wider recognition after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He was supported by his wife, poet Inna Lisnyanskaya. Lipkin was a close friend of Anna Akhmatova, Joseph Brodsky and Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Lipkin's poetry explores themes of history and philosophy.[2]

His poems reference his Jewish heritage and the Bible, and draw on his experiences in World War II and the Great Purge. Lipkin's opposition to the Soviet regime became public in 1979-1980 when he contributed to the uncensored almanac "Metropol." Subsequently, he and Lisnyanskaya left the Union of Soviet Writers.[3]
