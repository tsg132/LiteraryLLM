Telephone numbers in Russia (Russian: Телефонный план нумерации России) are administered by Roskomnadzor, and Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media of the Russian Federation.[2] Russia's National Numbering Plan (NNP) is a four-level telephone numbering plan with local, zone, country, and international scopes, implementing a closed numbering plan, in which the number of digits of all national significant numbers (NSN) assigned to subscriber telephones is fixed at ten,[3] with three digits for the area code, and a seven-digit subscriber number which includes a zone code of up to two digits.

Internationally, Russia participates in the numbering plans of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) provided by recommendations E.164 and E.123, using the telephone country code +7, which is shared with Kazakhstan, designating two area codes for routing calls to that country.

+7 ITU country code was originally assigned to the Soviet Union. After the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, the code continued to be used by the fifteen successor states, the majority of whom switched to own country codes from the +3xx and +9xx ranges between 1993 and 1998. Currently, the +7 country code is only assigned by ITU to two countries: Russia and Kazakhstan.
