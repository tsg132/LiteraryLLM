Vladimir Ivanovich Savchenko (Ukrainian: Володимир Іванович Савченко; Russian: Владимир Иванович Савченко) was a Soviet Ukrainian science fiction writer and engineer.

Born on February 15, 1933, in Poltava, he studied at the Moscow Power Engineering Institute and was an electronics engineer.[1] Savchenko, who wrote in Russian as well as in his native Ukrainian language[citation needed], published his first short stories in the late 1950s, and his first novel (Black Stars) in 1960. His works were often self-published.[2] Savchenko also authored several texts about physics and engineering, including the article "Sixteen New Formulas of Physics and Cosmology," which he considered to be his most important scientific text.[1]

As of today, Savchenko's works have been published in 29 countries and have been translated into many of the world's languages.[2]

He was found dead on January 19, 2005, in Kyiv. He was 71 years old.
