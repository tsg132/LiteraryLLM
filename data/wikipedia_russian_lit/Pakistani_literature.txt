Pakistani literature (Urdu: ادبیاتِ پاکستان) is a distinct literature that gradually came to be defined after Pakistan gained nationhood status in 1947, emerging out of literary traditions of the South Asia.[1] The shared tradition of Urdu literature and English literature of British India was inherited by the new state. Over a big time of period a body of literature unique to Pakistan has emerged in nearly all major Pakistani languages, including Urdu, English, Punjabi, Pushto, Balochi, Sindhi, and Seraiki.[2]

There have been many bibliographies and biographical dictionaries documenting Pakistani writers, including the Ahl-i-Qalam Directory published by the Pakistan Academy of Letters and often revised, in its 2010 edition including 3,500 writers but only those alive at that time.[3]
