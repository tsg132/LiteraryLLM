Russia is divided into twelve economic regions[a] â€” groups of federal subjects sharing the following characteristics:

No federal subject can belong to more than one economic region.

Economic regions are also grouped into economic zones (also called "macrozones"). An economic region or its parts can belong to more than one economic zone.

Establishment and abolition of economic regions and economic zones or any changes in their composition are decided upon by the federal government of Russia.

This division into economic regions is different from the division into federal districts. The former are solely for economic and statistical purposes, and the latter exist solely to uphold the federal laws on the territory of the country.
