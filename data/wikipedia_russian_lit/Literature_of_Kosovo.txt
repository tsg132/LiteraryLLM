The literature of Kosovo is composed of literary texts written in Albanian, Serbian, Bosnian, and Turkish, specifically by authors of Kosovo. Kosovo produced several prominent writers in the Ottoman era. However, Ottoman authorities banned the written use of the Albanian language until 1912. This policy continued during Serb rule until the outbreak of World War II.[1]

After the war, school tests were mostly in Serbian due to historic circumstances;[clarification needed] after Serbia acquired Kosovo,[clarification needed] Albanian-language schooling and publishing were suppressed.[2][when?] Underground literature flourished in the late 1940s, which were written and published in Albanian. Under Aleksandar RankoviÄ‡, everybody who bought the Albanian-language newspaper Rilindja was registered with the secret police.[3] Full Albanian-language and cultural facilities were granted by the Yugoslav constitution of 1974, and Kosovo Albanian literature and culture flourished.[1]
