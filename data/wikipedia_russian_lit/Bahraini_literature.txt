The literature of Bahrain has a strong tradition in the country. Most traditional writers and poets write in the classical Arabic style, contemporary poets that write in this style include Ali al-Sharqawi, Qassim Haddad, Ebrahim Al-Arrayedh, and Ahmad Muhammed Al Khalifa.[1] In recent years, the number of younger poets influenced by western literature are rising, most writing in free verse or prose poetry, and often including political or personal content.[1] Almost all publications of poetry in the country are in Arabic, with poetry rarely published in English without requiring prior translation.[2] Ali al-Sharqawi, a decorated longtime poet, is considered by many to be the literary icon of Bahrain.[3]  The country's local writing society, the Bahrain Writers Association, was founded in 1969.
