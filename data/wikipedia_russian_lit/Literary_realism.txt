Literary realism is a literary genre, part of the broader realism in arts, that attempts to represent subject-matter truthfully, avoiding speculative fiction and supernatural elements. It originated with the realist art movement that began with mid-nineteenth-century French literature (Stendhal) and Russian literature (Alexander Pushkin).[1] Literary realism attempts to represent familiar things as they are. Realist authors chose to depict every day and banal activities and experiences.
