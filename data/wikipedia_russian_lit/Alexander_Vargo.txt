Alexander Vargo (Russian: Александр Варго) is an official pseudonym used by group of Russian horror writers whose books are published by Eksmo publishing house in the Myst (Black Book) series.

Vargo's first novel, The Cook (Russian: Кулинар), was released in 2003. For several years readers thought that Alexander Vargo was a real author, but soon a rumor appeared that a whole group of writers was standing behind this name.
The rumor was proved true in the beginning of 2011 when Darker magazine released an interview with a few authors of the "Vargo"-team and they confirmed that the real Alexander Vargo never existed and the series was just a publisher's project .[citation needed] The name of the original "Vargo"-writer is Sergey Dyomin (Russian: Сергей Дёмин). Several of "Vargo's" books were also written by Igor Isaichev and Alexei Sholokhov.
