Army of the Tsardom of Russia (Russian: Армия Русского государства) known also as the Forces of the Russian State (Russian: Войско Русского государства) and as Forces of Muscovy (Russian: Войска московского государства) were the armed forces of the Tsardom of Russia, formerly the Principality of Moscow. The creation date of the Army of the Tsardom of Russia is ambiguous due to the fact that there was no formal establishment date, and the development of the unified army structure occurred concurrently with the centralization of the Russian state,[citation needed] which grew in territory[citation needed] and was based on the increasing political power of Principality of Muscovy. If relating to the narrow sense to the definition of Tsardom of Russia, it is the official assumption of the title of tsar by Ivan IV in 1547.[citation needed]
