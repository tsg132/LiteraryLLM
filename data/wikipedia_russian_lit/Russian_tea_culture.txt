Tea is an important part of Russian culture. Due in part to Russia's cold northern climate, it is today considered the de facto national beverage,[1] one of the most popular beverages in the country,[2] and is closely associated with traditional Russian culture. Russian tea is brewed and can be served sweet, and hot or cold. It is traditionally taken at afternoon tea, but has since spread as an all day drink, especially at the end of meals, served with dessert. A notable aspect of Russian tea culture is the samovar, which was widely used to boil water for brewing until the middle of the 20th century.
