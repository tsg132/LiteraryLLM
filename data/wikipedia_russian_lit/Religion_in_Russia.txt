Orthodox Christianity is the most widely professed religion in Russia, with significant minorities of non-religious people and adherents of other faiths.[3]

The constitution of Russia recognises the right to freedom of conscience and creed to all the citizenry, the spiritual contribution of Orthodox Christianity to the history of Russia, and respect to "Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism and other religions and creeds which constitute an inseparable part of the historical heritage of Russia's peoples",[4] including ethnic religions or paganism, either preserved, or revived.[5]
