Migrant workers in Russia, commonly referred to as Gastarbeiters (Russian: Гастарбайтеры, romanized: Gastarbaytery), form a significant part of Russia's workforce since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Comprising as much as 25% of the workforce, the majority of migrant workers come from Central Asia and the South Caucasus, and often work in low-level jobs.
