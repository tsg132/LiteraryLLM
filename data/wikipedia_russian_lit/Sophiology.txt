Sophiology (Russian: Софиология; by detractors also called  Sophianism
(Софианство) or Sophism (Софизм))  is a controversial school of thought in the Russian Orthodox tradition of Eastern Orthodox Christianity that holds that Divine Wisdom (or Sophia—Greek: σοφία; literally translatable to "wisdom") is to be identified with God's essence, and that this Divine Wisdom is in some way expressed in the world as 'creaturely' wisdom.[1] This notion has often been characterized as introducing a feminine "fourth hypostasis" into the Trinity.[2]
