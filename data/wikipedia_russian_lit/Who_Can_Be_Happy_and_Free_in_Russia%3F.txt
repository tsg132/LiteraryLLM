Who Lives Happily in Russia? (Russian: Кому на Руси жить хорошо, romanized: Komú na Rusí zhit' horoshó) is an epic four-part poem by Nikolai Nekrasov, which he started publishing in January 1866 in Sovremennik and Otechestvennye Zapiski. Its fourth part, "The Feast for All the World" (1876–1877), remained unfinished.[1][2]

The only full English translation was made in 1917, under the title Who Can Be Happy and Free in Russia?, by Juliet Soskice. The other suggested titles are Who Lives Happily in Russia?, Who Is Happy in Russia? and Who Can Be Happy in Russia?
