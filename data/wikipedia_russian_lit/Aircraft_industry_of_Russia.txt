Aircraft manufacturing is an important industrial sector in Russia, employing around 355,300 people.  The dissolution of the Soviet Union led to a deep crisis for the industry, especially for the civilian aircraft segment.  The situation started improving during the middle of the first decade of the 2000s due to growth in air transportation and increasing demand.  A consolidation programme launched in 2005 led to the creation of the United Aircraft Corporation holding company, which includes most of the industry's key companies. After 2022, reviving the passenger aircraft industry in Russia became the main goal.[1][2]

The Russian aircraft industry offers a portfolio of internationally competitive military aircraft such as MiG-29 and Su-27, while new projects such as the Sukhoi Superjet 100 are hoped to revive the fortunes of the civilian aircraft segment. In 2009, companies belonging to the United Aircraft Corporation delivered 95 new fixed-wing aircraft to its customers, including 15 civilian models.  In addition, the industry produced over 141 helicopters.
