The East Slavs are the most populous subgroup of the Slavs.[3] They speak the East Slavic languages,[4] and formed the majority of the population of the medieval state Kievan Rus', which they claim as their cultural ancestor.[5][6] Today Belarusians, Russians and Ukrainians are the existent East Slavic nations. Rusyns can also be considered as a separate nation, although they are often considered a subgroup of the Ukrainian people.
