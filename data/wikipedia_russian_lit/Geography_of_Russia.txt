Russia (Russian: Россия) is the largest country in the world, covering over 17,125,191 km2 (6,612,073 sq mi), and encompassing more than one-eighth of Earth's inhabited land area. Russia extends across eleven time zones, and has the most borders of any country in the world, with sixteen sovereign nations.[b]

Russia is a transcontinental country, stretching vastly over two continents, Europe and Asia.[1] It spans the northernmost edge of Eurasia, and has the world's fourth-longest coastline, at 37,653 km (23,396 mi).[c][3] Russia, alongside Canada and the United States, is one of only three countries with a coast along three oceans (however connection to the Atlantic Ocean is extremely remote),[1] due to which it has links with over thirteen marginal seas.[d][4] It lies between latitudes 41° and 82° N, and longitudes 19° E and 169° W. Russia is larger than three continents of the world[e] and has about the same surface area as Pluto.[6] Russia encompasses, by far, the largest  forest area of any country in the world.[7]
