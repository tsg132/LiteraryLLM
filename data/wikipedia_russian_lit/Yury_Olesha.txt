Yury Karlovich Olesha (Russian: Ю́рий Ка́рлович Оле́ша, 3 March [O.S. 19 February] 1899 – 10 May 1960) was a Russian and Soviet novelist.  He is considered one of the greatest Russian novelists of the 20th century, one of the few to have succeeded in writing works of lasting artistic value despite the stifling censorship of the era.  His works are delicate balancing acts that superficially send pro-Communist messages but reveal far greater subtlety and richness upon a deeper reading. Sometimes, he is grouped with his friends Ilf and Petrov, Isaac Babel, and Sigismund Krzhizhanovsky into the Odessa School of Writers.[1]
