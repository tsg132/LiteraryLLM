The second Russian avant-garde[1][2] (Russian: Вторая волна русского авангарда) was a movement in Russian art, primarily in fine arts and poetry, which began in the mid-1950s and ended in the late 1980s. The movement's birth is associated with the Khrushchev Thaw and with the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students in 1957 in Moscow. The concept was introduced into cultural circulation by Mikhail Grobman[3] during his visit to the Tel Aviv Art Museum in the late 1950s, and by the late 1980s the term had become a solidified historical movement.[4]
