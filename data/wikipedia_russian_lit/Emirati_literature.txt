The culture of the United Arab Emirates is part of the culture of Eastern Arabia.[1] Its historical population was a small tribal community that changed with the arrival of an influx of foreign nationals in the mid-20th century.[2] Emirati culture is a blend of Arabian, Islamic, and Persian cultures, with influences from the cultures of East Africa and Indian Subcontinent.[3] Islam has had a prominent influence on local architecture, music, attire, cuisine, and lifestyle.[4]

In the United Arab Emirates, the city of Al Ain in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[5] The Emirate of Sharjah was named "The Cultural capital of the Arab World" by UNESCO in 1998 and the "Capital of Islamic Culture for 2014" by the OIC.[6]
