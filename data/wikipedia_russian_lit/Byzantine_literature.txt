Byzantine literature is the Greek literature of the Middle Ages, whether written in the Byzantine Empire or outside its borders.[1] It was marked by a linguistic diglossy; two distinct forms of Byzantine Greek were used, a scholarly dialect based on Attic Greek, and a vernacular based on Koine Greek.[2][3] Most scholars consider 'literature' to include all medieval Greek texts,[2][4] but some define it with specific constraints.[5][6] Byzantine literature is the successor to Ancient Greek literature and forms the basis of Modern Greek literature, although it overlaps with both periods.[1]

The tradition saw the competing influences of Hellenism, Christianity, and earlier in the empire's history, Paganism.[2][1] There was a general flourishing of gnomai, hagiography, sermons, and particularly historiography, which became less individual-focused.[2] Poetry was often limited to musical hymnal forms, or the more niche epigram tradition, while ancient dramas and epics became obsolete.[2] The influential romantic epic Digenes Akritas is a major exception.

Until recent scholarship from Alexander Kazhdan, Simon Franklin and others, Byzantine literature was held in low regard by academia.[7][8] It was previously considered either an inferior variant of Ancient Greek or biblical literature, or only important for its contributions to Modern Greek literature.[2]
