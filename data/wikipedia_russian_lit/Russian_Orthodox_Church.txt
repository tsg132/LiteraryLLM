The Russian Orthodox Church (ROC; Russian: Русская православная церковь, romanized: Russkaya pravoslavnaya tserkov', abbreviated as РПЦ), also officially known as the Moscow Patriarchate (Московский патриархат, Moskovskiy patriarkhat),[12] is an autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Christian church. It has 194 dioceses inside Russia.[13] The primate of the ROC is the patriarch of Moscow and all Rus'.

The Christianization of Kievan Rus' commenced in 988 with the baptism of Vladimir the Great and his subjects by the clergy of the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople, which traditionally marks the beginning of the history of Russian Christianity.[14][15] Starting in the 14th century, Moscow served as the primary residence of the metropolitan,[16] and in 1448, the ROC declared autocephaly.[17] Later, in 1589, the metropolitan of Moscow was elevated to the position of patriarch with the consent of Constantinople.[18] In the mid-17th century, a series of reforms led to a schism in the Russian Church, as the Old Believers opposed the changes.[19]

The ROC currently claims exclusive jurisdiction over the Eastern Orthodox Christians, irrespective of their ethnic background, who reside in the former member republics of the Soviet Union, excluding Georgia. The ROC also created the autonomous Church of Japan and Chinese Orthodox Church. The ROC eparchies in Belarus and Latvia, since the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, enjoy various degrees of self-government, albeit short of the status of formal ecclesiastical autonomy.

The ROC should also not be confused with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia (or ROCOR, also known as the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad), headquartered in the United States. The ROCOR was instituted in the 1920s by Russian communities outside the Soviet Union, which had refused to recognise the authority of the Moscow Patriarchate that was de facto headed by Metropolitan Sergius Stragorodsky. The two churches reconciled on 17 May 2007; the ROCOR is now a self-governing part of the Russian Orthodox Church.
