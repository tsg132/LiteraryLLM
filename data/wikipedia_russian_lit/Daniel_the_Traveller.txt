Daniel the Traveller, known also as Daniel the Pilgrim (Russian: Даниил Паломник), Daniel of Kyiv, or Abbot Daniel,  was the first travel writer from the Kievan Rus.[1][2][3][4] He is known for travelling to the Holy Land in the aftermath of the First Crusade and his descriptions are important records of the region during that time. Some have identified him with a certain Daniel, bishop of Yuryev [ru; uk] between 1115 and 1122.[5]
