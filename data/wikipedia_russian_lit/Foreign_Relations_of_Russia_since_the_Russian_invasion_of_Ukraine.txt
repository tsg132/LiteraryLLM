On 24 February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale invasion, prompting the imposition of substantial economic and political sanctions by the EU, the UK, the US, Canada, and other countries. The Russian government has a specified "Unfriendly Countries List" which indicates those countries with which relations are now strained (or non-existent). A Foreign Policy Concept approved by president Vladimir Putin in 2023 identified Russia as a Eurasian civilization state; aligning the country more closely with Asia, the Islamic world, Africa, Latin America, and rest of the Global South, and seeking the end of Western hegemony in the international order.[1]
